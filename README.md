# TEAM SUMMARY

  ## Description

  This is a command-line app that runs with Node.js.
  
  The user is prompted with a series of questions about the different members on their team. They can choose to add a Manager, an Engineer or an Intern. When they have entered all of their employees and answered all of the accompanying questions for the given position, the app dynamically generates an html file. The html file holds information cards for all of the employees.

  ## Installation

  In order to use this app:

  1. Run `npm install` to install the `inquirer` and `jest` package dependencies.
  2. Run `node app.js` to invoke the app.

  ## Usage

  When the user runs `node app.js` they can add employees to their team and input information for each team member. They are prompted with a series of questions, which vary based on what type of employee they'd like to add. The responses to those questions are then used to create the html file and render a team summary page.

  This is depicted below with an example of an app created team summary.
